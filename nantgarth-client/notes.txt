On Startup
 - Load all textures into one big texture atlas?
 - Define sprites and animations in XML files?
 - Translate textures and sub textures into positions on main texture atlas?
 
Beware of max texture size - int maxSize = glGetInteger(GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE);
Texture atlas should probably also be generated to a power of two
